Items We have no current items currently. -------------------------------------- gasr Weaponry 'n Combat Everything about gasr combat is listed below. Mechanics If you are familiar with The Culling/Survival Of The Fittest/goo animal simulator then you will get well with gasr. If you don't know the combat mechanics, let me explain: Single Click Left Mouse Button is used in Jabbing. Jab attacks are fast but not so powerful attacks. Held Left Mouse Button is used in Charging. Charged attacks are slow but powerful attacks. Held Right Mouse Button is used in Blocking. Blocking helps you deflect all attacks coming from your opponent. You can also single click RMB to cancel your charged attack. Keyboard Q is used in Shoving. Shoving blocked opponents will unblock them, leaving them vulnerable for a period of time. ! FOR INFECTED ONLY ! Keyboard R is used for for Claw Shoving, aka Infecting. When you press R while looking at a player that is vulnerable ** , you will infect that user and refill your health. If you press R while looking at a dead player, you will get healed a small amount. Counters You can counter your opponent in various ways. Basic ways are: Blocking Blocking is a very basic and simple counter move. You can wait for your opponent to charge their attack, and block right before they hit you. This will stun them and give you time to deal damage to them or run away. Shoving Shoving can help you with blocking users. When you shove someone blocking, you will stun them. This will give you some time to attack your opponent. An advanced trick with shoving is: Charge up your attack. When you are about to hit your opponent, cancel your attack. They will think that you are about to hit them and they will block. When they block, you can surprise them with a shove and stun them.
